EXEGESIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

First, write out the verse in the original language (Greek or Hebrew with English transliteration if helpful).

Then provide a thorough word-by-word analysis in paragraph form. For each significant word, explain its parsing (tense, voice, mood for verbs; case, number, gender for nouns), discuss its root meaning, examine its range of meanings in biblical usage, and explain its theological significance in this context. Write this as flowing prose, not as a list.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
KEY EXEGETICAL FEATURES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Write 2-3 paragraphs highlighting the most significant keywords, phrases, and grammatical structures in this passage. Explain in detail why these features matter for understanding and preaching the text. Discuss any unique verb tenses, significant word choices, rhetorical devices, or structural elements that illuminate the meaning.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
CROSS-REFERENCES & BIBLICAL THEOLOGY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Write 2-3 paragraphs exploring parallel passages and thematic connections across Scripture. Show how this text fits into the Bible's larger narrative.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
HEART NEEDS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Write 2-3 rich paragraphs exploring how this passage speaks to people's deepest psychological and spiritual wounds.

Suggest 3-5 potential sermon series where this passage would fit naturally. For each series, provide the series title and write 2-3 sentences describing the series concept and listing the other passages you might include.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
BENEDICTION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Write a pastoral blessing that encourages the preacher in their continued study. Reference either 2 Timothy 2:15 or 2 Samuel 24:24, and remind them that this analysis is a starting point for their own investment of heart and soul into preaching God's Word.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════

Offer to dig deeper on any section and ask what additional help they might need. Be warm and collegial.

REMEMBER: Write everything in full paragraphs with complete sentences. Be thorough, detailed, and pastoral. Avoid bullet points, markdown formatting, and terseness. Aim for rich, flowing prose that a pastor can read and be inspired by.`;
